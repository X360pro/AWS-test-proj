The Student Math Performance Indicator project aimed to enhance the assessment of student mathematical abilities using a robust tech stack. Leveraging AWS ECR for container image storage and Docker for consistent development environments, the project ensured reliable and scalable deployments. GitHub Actions facilitated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD), automating testing and deployment processes to streamline updates and maintain high code quality. This integration of modern tools and practices allowed for efficient and effective management of student performance data.
